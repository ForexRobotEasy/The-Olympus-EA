//|  Terms of Reference: Writing Code for The Olympus EA            |
//|                                                                  |
//|  1. Develop and implement the necessary trade functions to        |
//|     support the eight refined strategies of The Olympus EA for    |
//|     SPX500.                                                      |
//|                                                                  |
//|  2. Ensure that the code accurately reflects the meticulously     |
//|     backtested and validated strategies, which have consistently  |
//|     generated returns 10 to 15 times higher than the drawdown     |
//|     during backtests.                                             |
//|                                                                  |
//|  3. Optimize the software for the dynamic market conditions of    |
//|     the Forex trading environment, taking into consideration      |
//|     the challenges of navigating the SPX500.                      |
//|                                                                  |
//|  4. Maintain a steady performance with a drawdown ratio of 1.69%  |
//|     over the past year.                                           |
//|                                                                  |
//|  5. The code should be designed to provide reliable Forex returns  |
//|     and consistent performance for traders.                       |
//|                                                                  |
//|  6. The technical specification should include only the necessary |
//|     trade functions required to implement the algorithm, without  |
//|     any additional requirements or text.                          |
//|                                                                  |
//|  7. The terms of reference should be concise, with a size of no   |
//|     more than 1500-2000 characters.                               |
